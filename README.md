# Predicting Employee Retention

This project is part of the upGrad Data Science Program and focuses on building a predictive model using **Logistic Regression** to identify employees likely to leave a company.

## 📁 Project Files

- `Predicting_Employee_Retention_Starter.ipynb` - Jupyter notebook with the full analysis and model.
- `Employee_Retention_Summary.pdf` - Final summary report of the findings and results.

## 🧠 Objective

To analyze employee data and predict retention using statistical methods and machine learning.
